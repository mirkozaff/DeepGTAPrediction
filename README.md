# DeepGtaPrediction
Code that I used to generate and run a car distance and speed prediction model with VPilot and DeepGTAV.

# Requirements
1. [DeepGTAV](https://github.com/ai-tor/DeepGTAV) must be installed and [VPilot](https://github.com/cpgeier/VPilot) must be in the same folder.

2. Python enviroment with:
- H5py 2.8.0
- OpenCV 3.1.0
- Tensorflow 1.18
- Keras 2.1.2
- Numpy 1.13.3
